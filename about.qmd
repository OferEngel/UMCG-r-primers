## A brief (and probably inaccurate) history of the RStudio/Posit Primers

In 2018, Garrett Grolemund (co-author of [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) created the RStudio Primers—a set of free interactive [{learnr}](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) apps to teach R to the public. These were hosted on a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) server maintained by RStudio and accessible through RStudio.cloud.

With [RStudio's rebranding to Posit in 2022](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-becoming-posit/), the lessons became the Posit Primers and remained accessible through [Posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/).

In December 2023, the Posit Primers were retired in favor of [Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) and [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/). These newer resources have been updated to the latest versions of {tidyverse} packages, and they're no longer interactive (which is probably a lot easier for Posit's education team to maintain).

For more about how these Primers were used in the past for teaching, please read [Andrew's about page](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/about.html)
