These were hosted on a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) server maintained by RStudio and accessible through RStudio.cloud.\n\nWith [RStudio's rebranding to Posit in 2022](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-becoming-posit/), the lessons became the Posit Primers and remained accessible through [Posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/).\n\nIn December 2023, the Posit Primers were retired in favor of [Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) and [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/). These newer resources have been updated to the latest versions of {tidyverse} packages, and they're no longer interactive (which is probably a lot easier for Posit's education team to maintain).\n\nFor more about how these Primers were used in the past for teaching, please read [Andrew's about page](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/about.html)\n\n## Legal stuff\n\nThe original primers were developed by the RStudio/Posit Education Team and made [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio-education/primers).
