After all, learning a new language can be hard!\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how to visualize data with R's most popular visualization package, `ggplot2`.\n\n\nThe tutorial focuses on three basic skills:\n\n1. How to create graphs with a reusable **template**\n1. How to add variables to a graph with **aesthetics**\n1. How to make different \"types\" of graphs with **geoms** \n\nIn this tutorial, we will use the [core tidyverse packages](http://tidyverse.org/), including `ggplot2`. I've already loaded the packages for you, so click below `next topic` to begin! \n\n***\n\nThese examples are excerpted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399.
