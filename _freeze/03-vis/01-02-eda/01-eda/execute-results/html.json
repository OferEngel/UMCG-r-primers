When you do EDA, you:\n\n1. Generate questions/hypotheses about your data\n\n1. Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and/or modeling your data\n\n1. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions\n\nEDA is an important part of any data analysis. You can use EDA to make discoveries about the world; or you can use EDA to ensure the quality of your data, asking questions about whether the data meets your standards or not.\n\n### The EDA mindset {.no-hide}\n\nEDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. More than anything, EDA is a state of mind. During the initial phases of EDA, you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. As your exploration continues, you will home in on lines of inquiry that reveal insights worth writing up and communicating to others.\n\n### Questions {.no-hide}\n\nYour goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.\n\n> \"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often\n> vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made\n> precise.\" \n> \n> --- John Tukey\n\n### Quantity vs Quality\n\nEDA is, fundamentally, a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking _quality_ questions is to generate a large _quantity_ of questions. It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights are contained in your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will highlight a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data---and develop a set of thought-provoking questions---if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.\n\n> \"There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical\n> routines.\" \n> \n> --- Sir David Cox\n\n### Two useful questions\n\nThere is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these questions as:\n\n1. What type of **variation** occurs **within** my variables?\n\n1. What type of **covariation** occurs **between** my variables?\n\nThe rest of this tutorial will look at these two questions. To make the discussion easier, let's define some terms...\n\n### Definitions\n\n* A __variable__ in statistics is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure. Examples include height, weight, name, eye color etc.. \n\n* A __value__ is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement. For example, the variable height may be measured multiple times, and will thus obtain different values: 182cm, 174cm, 168cm, ...etc\n  \n* An __observation__ or __case__ is a set of measurements associated with a certain object such as an individual person, a town or a specimen. For example, if you are observing people, each person would be associated with the __variables__ height, weight, age, eye color etc... An observation (say, a person) consist of several values of different types. We'll sometimes refer to an observation as a case or data point.\n\n* __Tabular data__ is a table of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is __tidy__ if each value is placed in its own cell, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row. \n    \n![](img/tidy-1.png)\n\n\nSo far, all of the data that you've seen has been tidy. In real-life, most data isn't tidy, so we'll come back to these ideas again in [Data Wrangling](/04-tidy-data/01-reshape-data/index.qmd).\n\nBelow you can see an example of tabular data, in which the observations (row) are associated with countries at certain years. The variables (columns) include `country`, `continent`, `year` etc... The value of the variable `lifeExp` in Egypt in the year 1982 is 56.0.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngap_sample\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 15 × 6\n   country          continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap\n   <fct>            <fct>     <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>\n 1 Denmark          Europe     1982    74.6   5117810    21688.\n 2 Egypt            Africa     1982    56.0  45681811     3504.\n 3 Brazil           Americas   2002    71.0 179914212     8131.\n 4 Finland          Europe     1997    77.1   5134406    23724.\n 5 Burkina Faso     Africa     1962    37.8   4919632      723.\n 6 Malaysia         Asia       1957    52.1   7739235     1810.\n 7 Norway           Europe     1957    73.4   3491938    11654.\n 8 Senegal          Africa     1962    41.5   3430243     1655.\n 9 Puerto Rico      Americas   1972    72.2   2847132     9123.\n10 Reunion          Africa     1987    71.9    562035     5303.\n11 Mozambique       Africa     1977    42.5  11127868      502.\n12 Somalia          Africa     1977    42.0   4353666     1451.\n13 Hong Kong, China Asia       1972    72     4115700     8316.\n14 Guatemala        Americas   1957    44.1   3640876     2617.\n15 Uruguay          Americas   1982    70.8   2953997     6920.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Review 1: Discovery or Confirmation?\n\nYou can think of science as a process with two steps: _discovery_ and _confirmation_. Scientists first observe the world to discover a hypothesis to test. Then, they devise a test to confirm the hypotheses against new data. If a hypothesis survives many tests, scientists begin to trust that it is a reliable explanation of the data.\n\nThe separation between discovery and confirmation is especially important for data scientists. It is easy for patterns to appear in data by coincidence. As a result, data scientists first look for patterns, and then try to confirm that the patterns exist in the real world. Sometimes this confirmation requires computing the probability that the pattern is due to random chance, a task that often involves collecting new data.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" icon=false .question}\n\n**Is EDA a tool for discovery or confirmation?**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_1\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_1()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_1\" id=\"answer_1_1\" value=\"Discovery\"/>\n<label>Discovery</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_1\" id=\"answer_1_2\" value=\"Confirmation\"/>\n<label>Confirmation</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_1\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_1() {var x, text; var x = document.forms['form_1']['answer_1'].value;if (x == 'Discovery'){text = 'Correct!

The data set describes 344 penguins spread across 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Each row in `penguins` displays a details about a bird, including the island it lives on, its bill length, its bill depth (i.e. how tall the bill is), its flipper length, its body mass, its sex, and the year its measurements were taken. You can use these measurements to deduce the penguin's species, which is also included in `penguins`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex     year\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>             <int>       <int> <fct>  <int>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750 male    2007\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800 female  2007\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250 female  2007\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA <NA>    2007\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450 female  2007\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650 male    2007\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625 female  2007\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6               195        4675 male    2007\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475 <NA>    2007\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           42            20.2               190        4250 <NA>    2007\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\" icon=false .question}\n\n**Which of these is a *variable* in the `penguins` dataset?**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_2\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_2()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_1\" value=\"Torgerson\"/>\n<label>Torgerson</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_2\" value=\"bill_length_mm\"/>\n<label>bill_length_mm</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_3\" value=\"bird\"/>\n<label>bird</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_2\" id=\"answer_2_4\" value=\"18.1\"/>\n<label>18.1</label>\n<br/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_2\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_2() {var x, text; var x = document.forms['form_2']['answer_2'].value;if (x == 'bill_length_mm'){text = 'Correct!';} else {text = 'I have a different answer';} document.getElementById('result_2').innerHTML = text; evaluate_final_score(); return false;}function evaluate_final_score(){\n         element = document.getElementById('checkdown_final_score');\n         if(element === null){return false;} else {var element, text, res1, res2, res3;res1 = document.getElementById('result_1').innerText == 'Correct!
