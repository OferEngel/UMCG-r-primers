However, two characteristics of data can short circuit this system. Data can not be easily visualized if\n\n1. Data points are all rounded to the same values.\n2. The data contains so many points that they occlude each other.\n\nThese features both create _overplotting_, the condition where multiple geoms in the plot are plotted on top of each other, hiding each other. This tutorial will show you several strategies for dealing with overplotting, introducing new geoms along the way.\n\nThe tutorial is adapted from [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).\n\nThe tutorial uses the {ggplot2} and {hexbin} packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n<section id=\"buttons\">\n<button id=\"continueButton\" class=\"btn btn-primary float-start me-2\">Continue</button>\n<a id=\"nextTopicButton\" class=\"btn btn-danger disabled\" href=\"01-overplotting.html\" role=\"button\">Next topic</a>\n<button id=\"resetButton\" class=\"btn btn-outline-warning btn-sm float-end\">Start over</button>\n</section>\n:::\n",
