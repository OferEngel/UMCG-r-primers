Here we will look at them and their derivatives. You will learn how to:\n\n* Make and interpret histograms\n* Adjust the **binwidth** of a histogram to reveal new information\n* Use geoms that are similar to histograms, such as __dotplots__, __frequency polygons__, and __densities__\n\n\n**Boxplots** display the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. **Count** plots display the relationship between two categorical variables. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use both. You can learn how to:\n\n* Make and interpret boxplots\n* Rotate boxplots by flipping the coordinate system of your plot\n* Use *violin* plots and *dotplots*, two geoms that are similar to boxplots\n* Make and interpret count plots\n\n\n\nA **scatterplot** displays the relationship between two continuous variables. Scatterplots are one of the most common types of graphs---in fact, you've met scatterplots already in [Visualization Basics](/01-basics/01-visualization-basics/). You can learn how to:\n\n* Make new types of scatterplots with `geom_text()` and `geom_jitter()`\n* Add multiple **layers** of geoms to a plot\n* Enhance scatterplots with `geom_smooth()`, `geom_rug()`, and `geom_repel()`\n* Change the **coordinate system** of a plot\n\n\nA **line graph** displays a functional relationship between two continuous variables. A **map**  displays spatial data. The two may seem different, but they are made in similar ways. This tutorial will examine them both. You can learn how to:\n\n* Make new types of line plots with `geom_step()`, `geom_area()`, `geom_path()`, and `geom_polygon()`\n* Avoid \"whipsawing\" with the group aesthetic\n* Find and plot map data with `geom_sf()`\n* Transform a coordinate system into a map projection with `coord_sf()`\n\n\nThe tutorials were adapted from [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).\n\nThe tutorial uses the {ggplot2} and {dplyr} packages, which have been pre-loaded for your convenience.\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n<section id=\"buttons\">\n<button id=\"continueButton\" class=\"btn btn-primary float-start me-2\">Continue</button>\n<a id=\"nextTopicButton\" class=\"btn btn-danger disabled\" href=\"01-histograms.html\" role=\"button\">Next topic</a>\n<button id=\"resetButton\" class=\"btn btn-outline-warning btn-sm float-end\">Start over</button>\n</section>\n:::\n",
