Along the way, you will master some of the most useful functions for isolating variables, cases, and values within a data frame:\n\n* `select()` and `filter()`, which let you extract rows and columns from a data frame\n* `arrange()`, which lets you reorder the rows in your data\n* `|>`, which organizes your code into reader-friendly \"pipes\"\n\nThis tutorial uses the [core tidyverse packages](http://tidyverse.org/), including {ggplot2}, {tibble}, and {dplyr}, as well as the {babynames} package. All of these packages have been pre-installed and pre-loaded for your convenience.\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n<section id=\"buttons\">\n<button id=\"continueButton\" class=\"btn btn-primary float-start me-2\">Continue</button>\n<a id=\"nextTopicButton\" class=\"btn btn-danger disabled\" href=\"01-your-name.html\" role=\"button\">Next topic</a>\n<button id=\"resetButton\" class=\"btn btn-outline-warning btn-sm float-end\">Start over</button>\n</section>\n:::\n",
